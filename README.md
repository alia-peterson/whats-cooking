## Introduction
The primary goal of [Whats-Cookin](https://github.com/alia-peterson/whats-cooking) is to help users plan their meals. They can search through a log of recipes, save their favorite recipes, and keep track of their pantry. The specifications can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/whats-cookin.html) and [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-2/refactor-tractor-wc.html)

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project's creation was to get experience working in an existing code base. It also allowed the opportunity to ractice using `Fetch` API and updating code to incorporate more modern functionality.
